# UniOps Nexus

## 🌍 Vision
UniOps Nexus is a prompt-engineered project that reveals the hidden stories behind food and workers.  
When a user clicks on a dish, they see:
- Ingredient origins (state, district, farm)
- Farmer details (name, age, working hours)
- Production methods (manual vs modern)
- Worker empowerment (wages, challenges)
- Health & society analysis
- Video-style storyboard with timings

## 🧩 Prompt Scripts
- `prompts/carrot_curry.txt`
- `prompts/chicken_fried_rice.txt`
- `prompts/textiles.txt`

## 🎯 Competition Flow
- **Prelims:** Carrot Curry demo → ingredient transparency + worker empowerment.
- **Finals:** Multiple dishes + textiles → expanded analysis + video storyboard.

## 🏆 Impact
- Middle-class affordability
- Worker respect
- Health awareness
- Transparent food systems for future generations
